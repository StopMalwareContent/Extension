## FAQ

### Why do we need StopMalwareContent if we have the StopModReposts extension?

The main reason is that StopModReposts is **not being actively mantained**, but this extension is receiving constant updates. It also uses the StopModReposts' ``Illegal-Mod-Sites`` list.

### Can I report a new website?

Sure! It's very simple, just [Click here](https://github.com/StopMalwareContent/Site-Tracker/issues/new?assignees=Nitrrine&labels=website+add&projects=&template=report-a-threat.md&title=Add+%28url+goes+here%29+to+the+blocklist) to open an issue about a new threat.

### There is a false-positive!

If StopMalwareContent is flagging something that it shouldn't, just [Click here](https://github.com/StopMalwareContent/Site-Tracker/issues/new?assignees=Nitrrine&labels=website+remove&projects=&template=report-a-false-positive.md&title=Remove+%28url+goes+here%29+from+block+list) to open an issue about a false-positive.
